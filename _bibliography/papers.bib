To date, economists have not focused on the privacy loss inherent in data publication. In their stead, these issues have been advanced almost exclusively by computer scientists who are primarily interested in technical problems associated with protecting privacy. Economists should join the discussion, first, to determine where to balance privacy protection against data quality; a social choice problem. Furthermore, economists must ensure new privacy models preserve the validity of public data for economic research.},

The approach address four main challenges for computational reproductions: a lack of standardization, aggregation issues, existing incentives for ``adversarial'' interactions, and the loss of knowledge from analyses that are never published. We then summarize the first 487 reproductions uploaded on the SSRP. The results show substantial heterogeneity in the ability to successfully reproduce empirical results in economics research, with approximately 30\% of recent studies meeting at least a basic definition of being computationally reproducible.},

  abstract = {This study pushes our understanding of research reliability by reproducing and replicating claims from 110 papers in leading economic and political science journals. The analysis involves computational reproducibility checks and robustness assessments. It reveals several patterns. First, we uncover a high rate of fully computationally reproducible results (over 85\%). Second, excluding minor issues like missing packages or broken pathways, we uncover coding errors for about 25\% of studies, with some studies containing multiple errors. Third, we test the robustness of the results to 5,511 re-analyses. We find a robustness reproducibility of about 70\%. Robustness reproducibility rates are relatively higher for re-analyses that introduce new data and lower for re-analyses that change the sample or the definition of the dependent variable. Fourth, 52\% of re-analysis effect size estimates are smaller than the original published estimates and the average statistical significance of a re-analysis is 77\% of the original. Lastly, we rely on six teams of researchers working independently to answer eight additional research questions on the determinants of robustness reproducibility. Most teams find a negative relationship between replicators' experience and reproducibility, while finding no relationship between reproducibility and the provision of intermediate or even raw data combined with the necessary cleaning codes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Journals have pushed for transparency of research through data availability policies. Such data policies improve availability of data and code, but what is the impact on reproducibility? We present results from a large reproduction exercise for articles published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, which has had a data availability policy since its inception in 2009. Out of 363 published articles, we assessed 274 articles. All articles provided some materials. We excluded 122 articles that required confidential or proprietary data or that required the replicator to otherwise obtain the data (44.5\% of assessed articles). We attempted to reproduce 152 articles and were able to fully reproduce the results of 68 (44.7\% of attempted reproductions). A further 66 (43.4\% of attempted reproductions) were partially reproduced. Many articles required complex code changes even when at least partially reproduced. We collect bibliometric characteristics of authors, but find no evidence for author characteristics as determinants of reproducibility. There does not appear to be a citation bonus for reproducibility. The data availability policy of this journal was effective to ensure availability of materials, but is insufficient to ensure reproduction without additional work by replicators.           ,              R\'esum\'e                            Les journaux militent pour la transparence de la recherche par le biais de politiques sur la disponibilit\'e des donn\'ees               . De telles politiques sur les donn\'ees am\'eliorent la disponibilit\'e des donn\'ees et du code, mais quelle en est l'incidence sur la reproductibilit\'e? Nous pr\'esentons les r\'esultats d'un grand exercice de reproduction pour des articles publi\'es dans le               American Economic Journal: Applied Economics               , qui a une politique de disponibilit\'e des donn\'ees depuis sa cr\'eation en 2009. Parmi les 363 articles publi\'es, nous en \'evaluons 274. Tous les articles avaient fourni certains documents. Nous avons exclu 122 articles qui n\'ecessitaient des donn\'ees confidentielles ou exclusives, ou qui exigeaient que la personne charg\'ee de la r\'eplication obtienne autrement les donn\'ees (44,5\% des articles \'evalu\'es). Nous avons tent\'e de reproduire 152 articles et avons r\'eussi \`a enti\`erement reproduire les r\'esultats de 68 articles (44,7\% des reproductions tent\'ees). Nous avons aussi partiellement reproduit 66 autres articles (43,4\% des reproductions tent\'ees). De nombreux articles n\'ecessitaient de complexes changements de code, m\^eme lorsqu'ils \'etaient au moins partiellement reproduits. Nous avons recueilli les caract\'eristiques bibliom\'etriques des auteurs, mais n'avons pas constat\'e qu'elles \'etaient d\'eterminantes pour la reproductibilit\'e. La reproductibilit\'e ne semble offrir aucun avantage en mati\`ere de citations. La politique de disponibilit\'e des donn\'ees de ce journal a \'et\'e efficace pour assurer la disponibilit\'e des documents, mais insuffisante pour assurer la reproduction sans travail suppl\'ementaire des personnes charg\'ees de la r\'eplication.},

  abstract = {This study explores why people choose to contribute metadata, which is data about data. Using a field experiment conducted with more than 3,000 authors of AEA journal articles, our control message reduces the uncertainty about the future value of metadata, whereas those from the treatment conditions additionally make the private or social benefits of metadata salient. Surprisingly, we find that participants in the control condition provide significantly more metadata compared to those in the treatments. This suggests that simply knowing that metadata will have value is sufficient to motivate people to contribute. Our results also highlight the importance of interface design in online field experiments.},

  abstract = {The Transparent Research Object Vocabulary (TROV) is a key element of the Transparency Certified (TRACE) approach to ensuring research trustworthiness. In contrast with methods that entail repeating computations in part or in full to verify that the descriptions of methods included in a publication are sufficient to reproduce reported results, the TRACE approach depends on a controlled computing environment termed a Transparent Research System (TRS) to guarantee that accurate, sufficiently complete, and otherwise trustworthy records are captured when results are obtained in the first place. Records identifying (1) the digital artifacts and computations that yielded a research result, (2) the TRS that witnessed the artifacts and supervised the computations, and (3) the specific conditions enforced by the TRS that warrant trust in these records, together constitute a Transparent Research Object (TRO). Digital signatures provided by the TRS and by a trusted third-party timestamp authority (TSA) guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the TRO. The controlled vocabulary TROV provides means to declare and query the properties of a TRO, to enumerate the dimensions of trustworthiness the TRS asserts for a TRO, and to verify that each such assertion is warranted by the documented capabilities of the TRS. Our approach for describing, publishing, and working with TROs imposes no restrictions on how computational artifacts are packaged or otherwise shared, and aims to be interoperable with, rather than to replace, current and future Research Object standards, archival formats, and repository layouts.},

  abstract = {Randomized control trials, RCTs, have become a powerful tool for assessing the impact of interventions and policies in many contexts. They are considered the gold-standard for inference in the biomedical fields and in many social sciences. Researchers have published an increasing number of studies that rely on RCTs for at least part of the inference, and these studies typically include the response data collected, de-identified and sometimes protected through traditional disclosure limitation methods. In this paper, we empirically assess the impact of strong privacy-preservation methodology (with \textbackslash ac\textbraceleft DP\textbraceright{} guarantees), on published analyses from RCTs, leveraging the availability of replication packages (research compendia) in economics and policy analysis. We provide simulations studies and demonstrate how we can replicate the analysis in a published economics article on privacy-protected data under various parametrizations. We find that relatively straightforward DP-based methods allow for inference-valid protection of the published data, though computational issues may limit more complex analyses from using these methods. The results have applicability to researchers wishing to share RCT data, especially in the context of low- and middle-income countries, with strong privacy protection.},

Within the Five Safes framework, data providers need to create safe data that can be provided to trusted safe people for use within safe settings, as part of safe projects. Finally, any findings that are shared publicly must be safe outputs. The processes used to create safe data and safe outputs (manipulations that render data less sensitive and therefore more appropriate for public release) are generally referred to as statistical disclosure limitation (SDL). This chapter describes techniques traditionally used within the field of SDL, pointing at methods as well as metrics to assess the resultant statistical quality and sensitivity of the data, and offers technical guidance applicable to any data provider or researcher looking for practical tools to apply to their own data to reduce the risk to privacy.},

The Data PASS Journal Editors Discussion Interface (JEDI, an online community for social science journal editors: www.dpjedi.org) has collated several resources on embedding open science in journal editing (www.dpjedi.org/resources). However, it can be overwhelming as an editor new to open science practices to know where to start. For this reason, we have created a guide for journal editors on how to get started with open science. The guide outlines steps that editors can take to implement open policies and practices within their journal, and goes through the what, why, how, and worries of each policy and practice. This manuscript introduces and summarizes the guide (full guide: https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/hstcx)).},

Data that need to be kept confidential are seen as an impediment to reproducibility, and privacy would seem to inhibit transparency. I bring a more nuanced view to the discussion, and show, using examples from over 1,000 reproducibility assessments, that confidential data can very well be used in reproducible and transparent research. The key insight is that access to most confidential data, while tedious, is open to hundreds if not thousands of researchers. In cases where few researchers can consider accessing such data in the future, reproducibility services, such as those provided by some journals, can provide some evidence for effective reproducibility even when the same data may not be available for future research.},
